## **Project Background**

At Visionlogix, we have developed an **AI model for Human Tracking and Detection**, trained using CCTV footage from our office environment. The system automatically detects individuals and classifies them as either **staff** or **non-staff visitors**.

To support this, a database of employee details is required so that the AI model can correctly recognize staff members. This is where the Employee Register Mobile Application UI comes into play.

## **Project Details**

Tool Used: **Figma**

Design Scope: Employee Register Mobile Application

Responsive Layouts:

üì± iPhone 14 (Full view)

## UI Features **(CRUD Operations)**:

‚ûï Add Employee (Name, Employee ID, and Image)

‚úèÔ∏è Update Employee details

üóëÔ∏è Delete Employee records

üìñ Read/View Employee information

## **Design Focus:**

Minimal and clean layout

Quick access to staff records

Adaptable across different screen sizes

## **Purpose of the UI**

This UI serves as the management interface for employee information in the Human Detection system. Its purpose is to:

Store and update staff identity details (Name, ID, Image).

Provide administrators with a simple tool to manage employee records.

Seamlessly integrate with the AI-based tracking system to validate staff vs non-staff.

## **About My Learning Journey**

This design project is also part of my self-learning in UI/UX design. Without formal training, I explored online resources, tutorials, and practice-based learning to create this UI. Working on this project allowed me to apply design principles to a real-world AI application at Visionlogix.

## **Feedback**

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism to help me improve my design process and enhance usability in future projects.
