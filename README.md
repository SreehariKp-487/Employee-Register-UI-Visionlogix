📌 Project Background

At Visionlogix, we have developed an AI model for Human Tracking and Detection, trained using CCTV footage from our office environment. The system automatically detects individuals and classifies them as either staff or non-staff visitors.

To support this, a database of employee details is required so that the AI model can correctly recognize staff members. This is where the Employee Register Mobile Application UI comes into play.

📚 About My Learning Journey

This design project is also part of my self-learning in UI/UX design. Without formal training, I explored online resources, tutorials, and practice-based learning to create this UI. Working on this project allowed me to apply design principles to a real-world AI application at Visionlogix.

📝 Feedback

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism to help me improve my design process and enhance usability in future projects.
